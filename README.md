# My Spring Boot and Microservices Project

## Overview

This repository contains a simple project that showcases the integration of several key technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of Java-based applications by providing a comprehensive infrastructure.
- **Spring MVC**: Provides a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for building web applications.
- **Hibernate**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for managing database interactions.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: A specification for managing relational data in Java applications.
- **Microservices**: Architecture style where services are designed as small, independently deployable components.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules:

1. **Core Module**: Contains common services and configurations shared across microservices.
2. **Service Module**: Demonstrates the use of Hibernate and JPA for managing data.
3. **Web Module**: Provides RESTful APIs using Spring MVC.
